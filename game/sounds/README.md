# 🎮 Simon Game

A classic **memory-based pattern game** built as a fun way to practice JavaScript and front-end development.  
The goal is simple: **watch the sequence, remember it, and repeat it correctly**. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, making the game progressively harder.

## 🧠 Game Rules

1. The game shows a **random sequence of colored button flashes** (and sounds).
2. You must **click/tap the buttons in the exact same order**.
3. Each successful round:
   - Increases the level by 1
   - Adds one more color to the pattern
4. If you press the **wrong button** at any point:
   - The game ends
   - Your score (level reached) is shown
   - You can restart and try again
